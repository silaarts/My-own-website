I am Dr. Sil Aarts, assistant professor working at the 'Living Lab in Ageing and Long-Term Care' [(Academische Werkplaats Ouderenzorg Zuid-Limburg, AWO-ZL)](<https://www.academischewerkplaatsouderenzorg.nl/>). We are part of research school CAPHRI, at [Maastricht University](<https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/nl>), constituted in the Southern part of Limburg, the Netherlands.

At this website, you can find information regarding my work, including a list of publications. In addition, my love for R is also displayed here by posting some of my #dataviz for [#TidyTuesday](<https://twitter.com/thomas_mock>). From time to time I will use this website to post a blog on topics like data, AI and technology.
