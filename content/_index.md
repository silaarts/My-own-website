I am Dr. Sil Aarts, assistant professor working at the 'Living Lab in Ageing and Long-Term Care' [(Academische Werkplaats Ouderenzorg Zuid-Limburg, AWO-ZL)](<https://www.academischewerkplaatsouderenzorg.nl/>). We are part of research school CAPHRI, at [Maastricht University](<https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/nl>), constituted in the Southern part of Limburg, the Netherlands.

At this website, you can not only find information regarding my work, but you can also find my list of publications, including a book on ethics in research. In addition, my love for R is also displayed here by posting some of my visualisations for [#TidyTuesday](<https://twitter.com/thomas_mock>). From time to time I will use this website to post a blog on topics like Artificial Intelligence, technology and ethics.
