I am a psychologist, with a master in neuropsychology. My PhD trajectory, which was conducted at two different research schools, i.e. Caphri and MHeNS (Mental Health and Neuroscience) at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/nl>), was focused on multimorbidity, i.e. the co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions within one person, and the adverse health effects thereof. In addition, my [PhD](/post/images/articles/Multimorbidity_in_general_practice_adverse_health_.pdf) focused on analyzing large amounts of data with innovative analyzing techniques such as data-and text mining.

In 2010, I worked 4 months at the National Institute on Ageing (NIA), part of National Institutes of Health (NIH), in Bethesda, Maryland, where I conducted a study on the co-occurrence of multimorbidity, disability and frailty. During my bachelor and master trajectory, I noticed my interest in and, consequently, knowledge off, statistics. Fortunately, this was also noticed by several professors who gave me the opportunity to get involved in teaching several statistical courses. During my PhD trajectory, I also published several articles regarding statistics (e.g. [The insignificance of statistical significance](/post/images/articles/The insignificance of statistical significance.pdf) and [The importance of effect sizes](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/13814788.2013.818655)).

In 2012, I declined a post-doc position at the Maastricht University in order to become a researcher and teacher at Fontys, a university of applied sciences. There, my focus was on how technology could improve quality of life. More specifically, on how technology could aid aging-in-place. During these years, I, together with colleagues, conducted longitudinal qualitative research including in-depth interviews with community-dwelling older adults. It was then that I also fell in love with this type of research!

From 2013 to 2018, I was a member of the Fontys Ethical Committee, in which research proposals were checked regarding ethical scientific guidelines. In this manner, I co-wrote a book entitled [‚ÄòEthiek van praktijkgericht onderzoek: zonder ethiek is het al moeilijk genoeg‚Äô](https://www.libris.nl/boek/?authortitle=eveline-wouters-sil-aarts/ethiek-van-praktijkgericht-onderzoek--9789036817516/). Please, see [my activities](https://silaarts.netlify.com/post/) for more information regarding my work.
